# Installing the AWS CLI<a name="cli-chap-install"></a>

The AWS Command Line Interface is available in two versions:

## AWS CLI version 2<a name="cli-chap-install-v2"></a>

**Preview Evaluation Software**  
AWS CLI version 2 is provided as a preview for testing and evaluation\. At this time we recommend that you do not use this in a production environment\. For production environments, we recommend that you instead use the generally available version 1\.x\.  
Please provide feedback for this developer preview version at [AWS CLI version 2 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is\%3Aissue+label%3Av2)\. Be sure to attach the "V2" label to your issue\.

AWS CLI version 2 is the most recent major version of the AWS CLI and supports all of the latest features\. Some features introduced in version 2 are not backward compatible with version 1 and you must upgrade to access those features\.

AWS CLI version 2 is available to install only as a bundled installer\. Although you might be able to find it in some package managers, these are not produced or managed by AWS and are therefore not official and not supported by AWS\. We recommend that you install the AWS CLI from only the official AWS distribution points as documented in this guide\.

For information about how to install AWS CLI version 2, see [Installing the AWS CLI version 2](install-cliv2.md)\.

## AWS CLI version 1<a name="cli-chap-install-v1"></a>

AWS CLI version 1 is the original CLI and continues to be supported\. However, major new features that are introduced in AWS CLI version 2 might not be backported to AWS CLI version 1\. To use those features, you must install AWS CLI version 2\.

For information about how to install AWS CLI version 1, see [Installing the AWS CLI version 1](install-cliv1.md)\.
