# Installing the AWS CLI version 2<a name="install-cliv2"></a>

**Preview Evaluation Software**  
AWS CLI version 2 is provided as a preview for testing and evaluation\. At this time we recommend that you do not use this in a production environment\. For production environments, we recommend that you instead use the generally available version 1\.x\.  
Please provide feedback for this developer preview version at [AWS CLI version 2 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is\%3Aissue+label%3Av2)\. Be sure to attach the "V2" label to your issue\.

This topic provides links to information about how to install version 2 of the AWS Command Line Interface on the supported operating systems\. For information about how to install AWS CLI version 1, see [Installing the AWS CLI version 1](install-cliv1.md)\.

**Note**  
For AWS CLI version 2, it doesn't matter if you have Python installed and if you do, it doesn't matter which version\. AWS CLI version 2 uses only the version of Python \(and all other dependencies\) that are included and installed into a local virtual environment that is isolated\.
