# Configuration and Credential Files<a name="cli-config-files"></a>

 The CLI stores credentials specified with `aws configure` in a local file named `credentials` in a folder named `.aws` in your home directory\. Home directory location varies but can be referred to using the environment variables `%UserProfile%` in Windows and `$HOME` or `~` \(tilde\) in Unix\-like systems\. 

 For example, the following commands list the contents of the `.aws` folder: 

**Linux, macOS, or Unix**

```
$ ls  ~/.aws
```

**Windows**

```
> dir "%UserProfile%\.aws"
```

 In order to separate credentials from less sensitive options, region and output format are stored in a separate file named `config` in the same folder\. 

 The default file location for the config file can be overridden by setting the AWS\_CONFIG\_FILE environment variable to another local path\. See [Environment Variables](cli-environment.md) for details\. 

**Storing Credentials in Config**  
 The AWS CLI will also read credentials from the config file\. If you want to keep all of your profile settings in a single file, you can\. If there are ever credentials in both locations for a profile \(say you used `aws configure` to update the profile's keys\), the keys in the credentials file will take precedence\.   
 If you use one of the SDKs in addition to the AWS CLI, you may notice additional warnings if credentials are not stored in their own file\. 

 The files generated by the CLI for the profile configured in the previous section look like this: 

**`~/.aws/credentials`**

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

**`~/.aws/config`**

```
[default]
region=us-west-2
output=json
```

The following settings are supported\.

 **aws\_access\_key\_id** – AWS access key\. 

 **aws\_secret\_access\_key** – AWS secret key\. 

 **aws\_session\_token** – AWS session token\. A session token is only required if you are using temporary security credentials\. 

 **region** – AWS region\. 

**output** – output format \(json, text, or table\)
